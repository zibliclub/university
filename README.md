# Content

Lessons are divided into folders, depending on the availability of notes or other content for a given lesson — into additional folders. The `.pdf` file with the content is called `master.pdf`, the same in the case of notes, `.tex` code is divided into lectures and there is a `main.tex` file that combines them. There is also `preamble.tex`.

> [!NOTE] 
> For **hyperlinks** to work in .pdf files, you need to download the file.
